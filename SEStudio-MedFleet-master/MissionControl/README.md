#Mission Control
Mission Control’s primary purpose is to plan missions, schedule drones, and to communicate with Ground Control. Its process starts by accepting connection requests from one or more Ground Control instances (the Java application uses multiple threads and gives each Ground Control instance its own thread).
#Changes needed to setup that i found 
Main.java
19 - update ip of webserver
24-25 update the id's of the drones

When Mission Control detects a new ticket, it decides which Ground Control instance should receive the ticket, makes sure the GPS coordinates are within the safety adherence zone, creates a route for the drone, and communicates the route to the Ground Control system.

Once Mission Control has passed all of this information to the Ground Station, it then listens for Ground Control to pass back data about the drones mission; Mission Control is responsible for taking this data and injecting it into the MongoDB.

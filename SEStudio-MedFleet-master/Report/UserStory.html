	<h4>Each user story is related to one or more of the following use cases:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Request Assistance (UC#01)</li>
		<li>Delivery of Medical Packages (UC#02)</li>
		<li>Med-Fleet Monitor (UC#03)</li>
		<li>Drones rerouted to speed up delivery to all sites (UC#04)</li>
		<li>Drone Changes altitude to avoid hitting other drone (UC#05)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The first sprint was the proof of concept sprint. &nbsp;In this sprint, we created the basic version of the phone app to send the severity and GPS location of the phone to the ticketing system. &nbsp;A basic framework of mission control was developed
		to handle one drone with one mission. &nbsp;The goal of our first sprint was complete a single mission.</p>
	</p>
	<p>The second sprint was to build on top of the proof of concept. &nbsp;In this sprint, we were able to update the phone app to integrate Google maps with a drop pin interface to give an accurate GPS coordinate. &nbsp;The Mission control was scaled up along
		with ground control to handle multiple missions for one drone.</p>
	</p>
	<p>The third sprint was scale up to have multiple drones work on multiple missions. &nbsp;We updated the phone app to confirm the GPS coordinates before sending a request. &nbsp;We included additional calculations to integrate distance and speed for mission
		control to generate the flight path for multiple drones.</p>

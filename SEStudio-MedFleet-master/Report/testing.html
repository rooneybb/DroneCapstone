<h1>Testing:</h1>
<p>The Med-Fleet system was subject to rigorous testing throughout each sprint. Due to the designation of it being a Safety-Critical system, the entire team understood the importance of such practice. With this thorough focus the Med-Fleet team was able to confidently work up to real-life simulations of the system in the deployment of two quarterly field tests. The Med-Fleet system is still not ready for production, as Safety-Critical systems, need to prove themselves nearly flawless. However all of the progress made towards a goal of moving to a beta-testing environment, can be widely attributed to the extensive testing already in place. The table below helps to give a brief overview of the many different types of testing used by the Med-Fleet team. </p>

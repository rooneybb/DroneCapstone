		<dt>2.4 Ghz</dt>
		<dd> The frequency used by digital (spread spectrum) radio communications in our applications, including 2.4Ghz RC, Bluetooth and some video transmission equipment. This is a different band than the older 72 Mhz band that is used for analog RC communications.
			To avoid radio frequency conflict is it often a good idea to use 72 Mhz radio equipment when you are using 2.4 Ghz onboard video transmitters, or use 900 Mhz video when using 2.4 Ghz RC equipment.</dd>

			to the UAV.</dd>
		<dt>Global Positioning System (GPS)</dt>
		<dd> Used to track movement or hold position at pre-defined coordinates.</dd>
		<dt>Gyroscope (GYRO)</dt>
		<dd> Provides the angular velocity around 3 axes of space in degrees. Assists with keeping a quadcopter level and facing the same direction.</dd>
		<dt>Lithium Polymer Battery (LIPO)</dt>
		<dd> Aka LiPoly. Most used power source for RC Hobby these days because of its high energy storage density-to-weight.</dd>
